      Rush Hour is a sliding block puzzle invented by Nob Yoshigahara in the
      1970s. It was first sold in the United States in 1996. It is now being
      manufactured by ThinkFun (formerly Binary Arts).
      ThinkFun now sells Rush Hour spin-offs Rush Hour Jr., Safari Rush Hour,
      Railroad Rush Hour, Rush Hour Brain Fitness and Rush Hour Shift, with
      puzzles by Scott Kim.

      The Regular Edition comes with 40 puzzles in 1 split up into 4 different
      difficulties, ranging from Beginner to Expert. The Deluxe Edition has a
      black playing board, card box in place of the board's own card tray and
      60 new puzzles with an extra difficulty: the Grand Master, which is harder
      than Expert. The Ultimate Collector's Edition also has a black playing
      board that can hold vehicles not in play and new way to display the
      current active card in a billboard like display. The Ultimate Collectors
      Edition also includes 155 new puzzles with some of them being from card
      set 3 and a white limo. The Regular Version includes a travel bag. Extra
      puzzle card packs (in addition to the 40, 60 or 155 cards included with
      the game) are also available. Also both the Deluxe Edition and the
      Ultimate Collector's Edition comes with all new shiny vehicles variant
      with the Ultimate Collector's Edition ones being slightly altered in
      design. Then in 2011, the board was changed to black, like the Deluxe
      Edition but with a card try and the cards was also changed to have new
      levels and design to match the new board color.

      The goal of the game is to get only the red car out through the exit of
      the board by moving the other vehicles out of its way. However, the cars
      and trucks (set up before play, according to a puzzle card) obstruct the
      path which makes the puzzle harder <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_Hour_(puzzle)"> (Wikipedia 2018).</a>
